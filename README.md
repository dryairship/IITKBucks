IITKBucks is a cryprocurrency project that I mentored as a part of Programming Club's Summer Camp 2020. This repository contains the code for my client, implemented in Go.

## The Project

A short documentation of the project is available at [https://iitkbucks.pclub.in/](https://iitkbucks.pclub.in/). The messages and notes shared with the students who did the project are available at [dryairship/IITKBucks-meta](https://github.com/dryairship/IITKBucks-meta/).
